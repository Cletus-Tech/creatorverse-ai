## 2026-11-06 — CreatorVerse AI assistant interface redesign

Status: **Implemented on `main`; deployment and browser QA pending.**

- Replaced the dark, basic chat panel with a professional assistant workspace: compact dark mode sidebar, clean light conversation canvas, polished header, prompt starter cards and a clearer message composer.
- Updated typography, spacing, borders, shadows, colour accents and mobile breakpoints for a cleaner desktop and phone experience.
- Kept the existing authenticated-only route, General and CreatorVerse specialist modes, conversation/message persistence and Supabase Edge Function endpoint/payload intact.
- Added functional starter prompts to fresh conversations, textarea auto-resizing, clearer loading feedback and safer response/error handling.
- No AI model/provider, Edge Function, database schema, RLS, authentication or billing changes were made.
- Remaining checks: deploy, inspect desktop/mobile rendering, test both modes, send/receive messages, verify saved conversation/message records, and check keyboard behavior.
